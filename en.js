    q1: '1. Unlike stock markets, the forex market has neither a central exchange nor an actual physical location. Since forex transactions are conducted over the phone or through electronic networks between two counterparts, the forex market is considered an "interbank" or "over-the-counter" (OTC) market.',
    q2: '2. The term PIP stands for "percentage in point" and is the smallest increment of trade in FX.',
    q3: "3. The __________ is the amount of pips between the bid price and the ask price. This is how forex brokers make their money on every forex trade placed through their network.",
    q4: "4. If you have too many floating losses and your trading account no longer has enough money to support the open trades you will be issued a __________.",
    q5: "5. If an investor cannot make a further payment to meet a Margin Call requirement, the OTC CFD provider has the discretion to liquidate or close-out the clients OTC CFD position, without reference to the investor. ",
    q6: "6. Forex trading can be very risky if you dont use proper risk management. Forex is considered to be one of the most risky forms of investing because of the availability of leverage.",
    q7: "7. AS an OTC CFD investor WITH a financial services broker, ANY deposits I provide TO the broker are held IN a Client Trust account which IS segregated FROM\tthe brokers operating account.",
    q8: "8. In forex trading, all currencies are quoted in pairs. For example, in comparing the Euro Dollar (EUR) to the US Dollar (USD), you would quote the currency pair EUR/USD. When we display a forex quote for this pair, we are saying how many dollars each Euro is worth. If the quote is EUR/USD 1.29 that says 1 Euro is worth __________.",
    q9: "9. An investor in an OTC CFD cannot lose more than their initial investment when investing in OTC CFDs.",
    q10: "10. If you open 2 standard lots of USD/JPY then you would be trading $200,000 against the equivalent amount of JPY. If you had $10,000 in your account your leverage ratio with the above position would be 20:1. This means that a 1% move in the USD/JPY currency pair would represent what percentage move in your account?",
